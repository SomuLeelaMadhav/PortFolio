1. NanoTechnology in Patient disease monitoring, medicine, and science  [Jan 18]
-	Under the topic "NanoTechnology in Patient Disease Monitoring, Medicine, and Science," we presented a novel method of training called "target space training." This approach is centered on improving model generalization, reducing the loss function in the target space, and addressing problems associated with exploding gradients. It is noteworthy that this methodology might want substantial computational resources. Interestingly, our methodology outperformed traditional methods in terms of accuracy, highlighting its potential for medical applications and state-of-the-art illness monitoring in the field of nanotechnology.

-	Regarding "Liver Disease Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques," we introduced a new training approach known as "target space training." By training models to minimize the loss function in the target space, this strategy helps to improve model generalization and solves issues related to exploding gradients. It should be noted that this method could need a significant amount of processing power. Crucially, our approach demonstrated higher accuracy than conventional machine learning methods, highlighting its potential for improved liver disease prediction.
  
3. Deep Learning in Target Space and “xAi”  for Predicting Brain Tumor, Segmentation [Jan 2023]
-	This study introduced a novel training methodology called “target space training,” wherein the model is trained to minimize the loss function in the target space rather than the input space. This also addresses the problems related to exploding gradients and improves models’ ability to generalize data. This method may require high computational power. This approach has shown greater accuracy when compared to other deep learning models such as ResNet, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN.
